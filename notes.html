LOG
    01/06/2024
        Wrapped app in contextprovider comp
        implemented context in all components removing prop drillling and unnecessary comp prop types
        created todocontext component abstracting away all state from app
        created useTodoContext custom hook abstracting away logic of validating null case of todocontext
        created todocontextype with union type type | null 

VITE - initialize react app
    Tool that provides a streamlined efficient and fast way to build front end applications  

    npm create vite@latest . 
        y
        react
        react-typescript
        npm install 
        npm run dev

REACT TIPS
    /SRC
        Place where most development takes 

    id="root"
        Root where the rest of the app will be inserted by react

    <> 
        Fragments of react which are section dividers that don't clutter the html with extra divs.

    return (
        Allows for returning something spamming multiple lines
    )

    Blanck page no render
        Look for an error 

    Component
        Independent reusable piece of javscript functions that return html
        Write your htlm, wrap it inside a component and return it. 
        Allows for the reusing of markup and cleaner looks.

        EXPORT DEFAULT FUNCTION component_name
            Benefit is you can export directly in the name and avoid export at the bottom of the component

    PROPS
        information sent in the component instance that will be read from the component definition to determine the behavior

        Typscript
            Will tell you if you have props with unclear data types
            Will tell you that you are using props in your definition that your instance is not sending
            Will tell you if you have unused variables
    React UI
        Composition of components

    MAPPING OVER LIST ITEMS
        Use map to return a react component with props and keys

    HOOKS
        Special functions that allows for the use of special features in function components. 

        useState
            remembers data changes to re render ui accordingly
        useEffect
            manages effects outside react control like fetch data, subsriptions, DOM.
        useContext
            shares data across comps without prop drilling
        useRef
            createsd a ref to a DOM element that persists across renders.
        useReducer
            manages more complex state logic and centralizes it

    useState
        Hook used to store data that may change in the life cycle of a comp.
        Allows react to be aware and on the alert for changes in this data and re render accordingly.

        modifying previos state
        modifying previos complex state 
        modifying previous complex state in a list

    e.stopPropagation()
        The e.stopPropagation() method is used to stop the event from propagating further during the bubbling phase.

    PROP DRILLING
        Moving state down beneath where some comps need it but passing it through a lot that don't like (header) b/c (counter) needs it.

    e.preventDefault()
        Stops default behavior in submit event for forms in which it reloads the page and other unwanted side effects. 

    controlled Inputs
        The value of the input is determined by reacts state

    onSubmit
        event by which we control the forms

    onChange
        input by which we get the value of an input

    Conditional Rendering
        Practice of rendering different UI elements based on certain conditions. Display content dynamically based on state, props or logic.

    Restricting functionality 
        If statement to control the number of allowed todos if user is not logged in.

    BETTER APP STRUCTURE
        PROBLEM
            state management is scattered throughout the app. It is difficult 
            to know where the changes are being made and how. 

        SHOULD BE
            1)state and state managers should always be in the same place for easy efficient understanding of logic. 
            2)always send as props entire functions and not only the setState function

    DERIVED STATE
        all calculations of a state in 1 place. Always together. 

    COMPLEX STATE MANAGEMENT
        Too much prop drilling 
        If we want to change structure, all that prop drilling is useless
        Means props for each component that does not need it, extra work...

    REACT CONTEXT API(ZUSTAND / REDUX)
        Component to hold all state, derived state and handlers and wrap around the app.
        
        CONTEXT FOLDER
            TodosContextProvider.tsx

        SYNTAX
            <Context>
                <App>
            </Context>

        STAGES OF OUR STATE 
            1)state in todolist, functions in each component that uses them
            2)state in app, functions in app
            3)state in context provider, functions in context provider

    CUSTOM HOOK 
        If there is logic that will become repeatable involving a hook, create a function with a hook inside it.

        example
            creating custom hook to validate the null scenarion for our todosContext.
            
    USEEFFECT
        Handle side effects for things React does not have precise control over. 

        WHEN DOES IT RUN
            After component renders, AT THE VERY END.

        PROBLEM WITH USE EFFECT AFTER FIRST LOAD WHEN TRYING TO READ AND WRITE TO LOCAL STORAGE



        
        

UI tips
    Little opacity keeps the palette opens possiblities.

TYPESCRIPT
    npm install typescript --save-dev (with node installed)

    In Js
        static typing / explicit
            let message: string = "hello"
        inference
            let message = "hello" -> ts assumes it is and can only be string
        interfaces
            interface Person {
                name: string,
                age: 30
            }
        type aliases(custom types for complex structures)
            type Coordinates = {
                x: number,
                y: number
            }
        enums(named specific constraints)
            enum Status {
                Active: 'ACTIVE',
                Inactive: 'INACTIVE',
                Pending: 'PENDING'
            }      
            let userStatus: Status = Status.Active
        Functions(define parameters and return values)
            function add(x:number, y:number):number {
                return x + y
            }
            let sum: number = add(5,10)
        optional and default parameters
            function greet(name: string, age?: number): string {
                return `Hello ${name}, ${age ? `you are ${age} years old` : 'age is unknown'}`;
            }
            console.log(greet('Alice'));            // "Hello Alice, age is unknown"
            console.log(greet('Bob', 30));         // "Hello Bob, you are 30 years old"
        Handling Arrays
            let stringArray: string[] = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];
            let numberArray: number[] = [1, 2, 3];

    Benefits in js
        Early Error DetectioN
        Enhanced IDE Support
        Self-Documenting Code
        Code Refactoring


    Benefits for use in react
        Static typing 
        Early error detection
        Guard rails to avoid mistakes
        Intellisense(suggestions)

    Prop validation
        define the shape of props explicitly ensuring the correct data is passed to comps.

        Example
            type ButtonProps = {
                label: string 
                onClick: () => void
            }

            const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({label, onClick}) => <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>

    State management 
        ensures state variables and updates conform to expected types

        EXAMPLE
            const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0)

    Event Handling
        Provides strong typing for events, making it easier to manage and understand DOM events.

        EXAMPLE
            const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
                console.log(e.target.value);
            };

    USES IN TODO WITH BYTEGRAD
        state typing
        function parameter typing 
        prop typing
        type aliasing for comp prop obj
        optional property in button / btn type
        union type to indicate one or another value ONLY / btn type
        export of type alias Todo / always out of comp dec
        lib folder -> types -> condense of reusable typescript types 
        context needs a type as well - union types default context state <TodoContextType | None>
        useState default: accepts functions returning the type or empty data type 
        removing parameters from function from library, too much hastle

    WHAT I SEE
        lets you know in 1 place all the props you will be using and the type it will use
        type needs to be declared outside component definition
